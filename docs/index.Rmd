## Introduction
Hi, I'm Haoran (Tommy) Fang, a data science major with a business minor. I enjoy going to the gym, cooking, and writing short stories. I’m also into watching a wide range of shows and anime, and I have a personal interest in heels. I'm a resilient and creative learner who enjoys exploring new ideas and perspectives. Whether it's through data or storytelling, I’m always looking for ways to grow and express myself.
